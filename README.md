This repository contains a simple Tcl procedure that demonstrates a common coding error: division by zero.  The `badproc` procedure does not include error handling to prevent division by zero when the first argument is 0.  A solution is provided in the `bugSolution.tcl` file demonstrating how to properly handle this error.

This is a classic example of how a seemingly small oversight can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect results in a program.
